Since the presentation, some changes were made in the project:
1- Sign out added:
	-When signed in, user page (can be accessed by clicking on the user name) has the 
	sign out option.
2- Name Surname and exp date added to buy product:
	-When buy page is accessed through the cart menu, buy page asks for card number, 
	cvc2, name, surname and exp date (during the presentation it was only card number 
	and cvc2)
3- Edit user info added:
	-When signed in, user page has the edit option. It asks for the old password, new 
	password and the previous user info can be edited. (When save button is clicked, if 
	the correct old password for user is not entered, changes are not saved)
4- Shopping Cart added:
	-Shopping cart becomes available when the user is signed in. It appears next to the 
	user name showing the item number in the cart. Cart menu can be accessed by clicking 
	on the cart. Buy option is now on cart page.  (In the presentation, product info page 
	had the buy product option. Now it has add to cart option. A product needs to be added 
	to cart before it can be bought. Many different products can be bought at the same time.)
5- Delete user added:
	-When signed in, user page has the delete user option. Delete option asks for users password, 
	if the correct password is entered, it removes the user from the database.
6- All predefined users has the password 123456. Its hashed so the database shows a different value
7- When a new user is signing up, website checks to see if mail address has the character @. 

IMPORTANT:Connections for the website uses a local database so its set to the path of that database using its path "jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/webdatabaseproje" password is "proje" and username is "proje". New connection must be set before running the program.
